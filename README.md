# EREDIS
Note: This fork is modified so as to build with latest hiredis.

Eredis is a C client library built over Hiredis.
It is lightweight, high performance, reentrant and thread-safe.  
It aims to provide features for real production environment and keep it simple.

For write commands (SET, HSET, EXPIRE, ...):
* Async commands via asynchronous events (libev)
* Async commands mirroring across multiple redis servers (shared-nothing)

For any commands:
* Thread-safe high speed pool of blocking connections: efficient persistent connections
* Automatic and seamless fail-over and reconnect

Integration:
* Reply structure is the Hiredis efficient redisReply
* Eredis allows you to switch from a single host mode to a an efficient
shared-nothing/fail-over mode by just activating a new host.


The integrated master-slave mechanism in Redis works ok
for a small number of nodes or workload, but it could kill a
master node bandwidth in high load.
The many-to-many mechanism permits a more efficient and reliable
workload by obviously needing exactly the same bandwidth on each node.


## Compile

Dependencies required: libev, [hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis)

```shell
git clone <eredis_git_url>
cd eredis
cmake .
make
# optional
make doc
make install
```

## Test

If you have Redis installed, and are not cross-compiling, you can run
the test suite that comes with Eredis after you have built the library
itself (using the steps in the compile section, above) with the `test`
target.

```shell
make test
```

## Usage

Each function is described in the C code (doxygen).  
The raw list is available in the unique header file: [eredis.h](/include/eredis.h "eredis.h").

### init
```c
#include <eredis.h>

eredis_t *e = eredis_new();

/* Set timeout - default 5000ms */
eredis_timeout( e, 200 );

/* Set max readers - default 10 */
eredis_r_max( e, 50 );

/* Set retry for reader - default 1 */
eredis_r_retry( e, 1 );
```

### add redis targets
The first host provided becomes the "prefered" one.  
The readers will always reconnect to this one in case of a down/up event.  
```c
/* manually */
eredis_host_add( e, "/var/run/eredis.sock", 0 );
eredis_host_add( e, "host2", 6379 );
eredis_host_add( e, "host3", 6379 );

/* via configuration file - one line per host:port */
eredis_host_file( e, "my-hosts.conf" );
```

### add post-connection requests (beta)
For 'AUTH' or any one-time command needed to be executed after connect.
Eredis ensures that these commands are executed in order before any other
reader or writer commands.
```c
char *pwd = "mysecret";
eredis_pc_cmd( e, "AUTH mysecret" );
eredis_pc_cmd( e, "AUTH %s", pwd );
eredis_pc_cmd( e, "SCRIPT DEBUG YES" );
```

### launch the async loop
Mandatory for using async writes or auto-reconnection to the "prefered" host.
```c
/* in its own thread - blocking call */
eredis_run( e );

/* in a eredis managed thread - non-blocking call */
eredis_run_thr( e );
```

### sync requests (to get reply)
```c
eredis_reader_t *r;
eredis_reply_t *reply; /* aka redisReply from hiredis */

/* get a reader */
r = eredis_r( e );

/* Add one request (pipelining) */
eredis_r_append_cmd( reader, "GET key1");

/* Add one request and process,
   return key1 reply (the first one from queue) */
reply = eredis_r_cmd( reader, "GET key2");

if ( I_NEED_ALL_REPLIES ) {
 /* current 'reply' hosts 'key1' reply */

 /* Get key2 reply */
 reply = eredis_r_reply( reader );
 ...
}

if ( I_NEED_TO_SEND_MORE ) {
 /* this one fetches all possible replies left in the pipelining */
 eredis_r_clear( reader );

 /* reader is ready to perform a new batch of r_cmd+replies */
 ..
}

/* Release the reader */
eredis_r_release( r );
```

### subscribe requests (beta, blocking)
```c
eredis_reader_t *r;
eredis_reply_t *reply; /* aka redisReply from hiredis */

/* get a reader */
r = eredis_r( e );

/* Add one request */
eredis_r_append_cmd( reader, "SUBSCRIBE chan1");

/* Get subscribe requests.
   Replies from SUBSCRIBE commands are omitted.
   Eredis manages reconnect and re-subscribe to channels */

while (( reply = eredis_r_subscribe( reader ) ))
{
 ...
 if ( HAVE_ENOUGH )
  break;
}

/* Add a new channel */
eredis_r_append_cmd( reader, "SUBSCRIBE chan2");

while (( reply = eredis_r_subscribe( reader ) ))
{
 ...
 if ( HAVE_ENOUGH )
  break;
}

/* 'release' is not disconnecting, just unsubscribe properly */
eredis_r_cmd( reader, "UNSUBSCRIBE" );

/* Release the reader */
eredis_r_release( r );
```

### async requests (no reply, non-blocking)
```c
eredis_w_cmd( e, "SET key1 10" );
```

### stop
```c
/* Exit the event loop (from any thread) */
eredis_shutdown( e );

/* Stop the event loop and threadif needed,
   close connections and release memory */
eredis_free( e );
```

## Day-to-day

When a Redis server goes down, Eredis async loop will detect it and
retry to reconnect every second HOST_DISCONNECTED_RETRIES (10) times (= 10 seconds).   
After this, it will retry once every HOST_FAILED_RETRY_AFTER (20) seconds.

To avoid data loss, if all specified Redis server are down, Eredis will
keep in memory the last unsent QUEUE_MAX_UNSHIFT (10000) commands.

If a Redis server goes down and up, it could be needed to resynchronize
with an active node. The master-slave mechanism is perfect for that.  
In redis.conf, add 'slave-read-only no'.  
After the Redis server start, make a "redis-cli SLAVEOF hostX".  
Once 'redis-cli info Replication' pops a 'master_sync_in_progress:0', it's done.  
make a "redis-cli SLAVEOF no one" and it comes back to a 'master' status.  
This process can easily be scripted.
